                <p><span>A little about me.</span> Born and raised in the UK, I moved to New York City on a whim 15 years ago and fell in love. My journey into tech started when I had my daughter & like many women, I had a choice to make: go back to work, stay at home, other??. I decided to create my online shop Color Me WHIMSY. I took classes in Entrepreneurship & designed my store myself, doing everything from customization to SEO to Social Media.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-2">
                <p>I loved the technical side of running my business & grew passionate about learning new methods & staying current and up-to-date with new trends, & I really loved passing on my knowledge, helping others with their pain points & struggles. I decided to take the leap & follow my passion. I found a great course to teach me the basics & some excellent mentors to guide my journey now here I am, living, learning, & leveling up.</p>
